Hangman Game

Hangman is one of the very first games which we used to play in our childhood. The computer randomly selects a word for you to guess. You are given max 8 chances to guess. The word can be of any length as denoted by the '-' in the output.

In case, you guessed the letter right, the letter will be placed in its right position in the word. Keep guessing till you find the right word or you run out of guesses.
P.S. correct guesses don't result in reduction in the number of wrong guesses.

Play the game and re-live you childhood!
